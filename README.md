# Fundamentals-of-Programming-Project
This was the course project for my Fundamentals of Programming course. Throughout the semester of this course I worked on this project, adding functionality to it as I learned new concepts and ultimately producing the final program. The program is effectively a selection menu that allows you to input a number to select an opperation you'd like to preform. The comments at the top of the code list all the individual changes that were made throughout the course of this class, and this program serves to demonstrate almost all that I learned during the class.
